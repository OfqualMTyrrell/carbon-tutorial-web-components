# Specification Quality Checklist: Mobile Navigation Menu Button

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Specification is written in plain language focusing on user needs and outcomes. No programming languages,
frameworks (React, Vue), or specific APIs mentioned. All content describes WHAT users need, not HOW to implement it.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - All functional requirements are testable and measurable:

- FR-001 through FR-016 each specify clear, verifiable behaviors
- No ambiguous requirements like "should work well" or "be fast"
- Each requirement uses concrete language: "MUST provide", "MUST toggle", "MUST close"
- Success criteria define specific metrics (2 clicks, 200-300ms, 100% viewports)
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions (rapid toggling, viewport changes, animation preferences)

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning phase:

- User stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1, P2)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format with specific outcomes
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused (not system-focused)
- Scope is bounded to mobile navigation menu functionality
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present

## Notes

**Spec Quality**: Excellent - specification follows all quality guidelines and is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Key Strengths**:

1. Clear prioritization of user stories (P1 = core mobile navigation, P2 = responsive behavior and accessibility)
2. Comprehensive functional requirements covering behavior, accessibility, and Carbon Design System compliance
3. Well-defined edge cases anticipating real-world usage scenarios
4. Technology-agnostic success criteria focusing on user outcomes

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ Yes - proceed with `/speckit.plan` to break down into tasks
