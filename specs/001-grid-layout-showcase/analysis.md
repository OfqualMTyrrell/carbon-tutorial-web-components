## Findings by Severity

### CRITICAL Issues (0)

_No blocking issues found._

### HIGH Issues (0)

_No high-priority issues found._

### MEDIUM Issues (2)

**M-1: Branch Name Inconsistency in spec.md**

- **Location**: spec.md line 4 vs actual branch name
- **Description**: Spec header shows `1-grid-layout-showcase` but actual branch is `001-grid-layout-showcase` (with
  leading zeros). Plan.md correctly uses `001-grid-layout-showcase`.
- **Impact**: Minor confusion for developers checking out the branch; no functional impact
- **Recommendation**: Update spec.md header to `001-grid-layout-showcase` for consistency
- **Severity**: MEDIUM (consistency issue, not blocking)

**M-2: File Path Inconsistency in Success Criteria**

- **Location**: spec.md SC-001, SC-005 reference `specs/1-grid-layout-showcase/demo/` and
  `specs/1-grid-layout-showcase/README.md`
- **Description**: Success criteria use `1-grid-layout-showcase` while tasks use `001-grid-layout-showcase`
- **Impact**: Minor developer confusion when validating success criteria
- **Recommendation**: Update spec.md to consistently use `001-grid-layout-showcase` in all file paths
- **Severity**: MEDIUM (consistency issue, not blocking)

### LOW Issues (2)

**L-1: Optional NFR Labeling**

- **Location**: spec.md Requirements section
- **Description**: No explicit non-functional requirements (NFR-001, etc.) section. Performance goal (<500ms load) and
  accessibility requirements are mentioned but not labeled as NFR-XXX.
- **Impact**: None (functional requirements cover all deliverables; constitution enforces accessibility/performance
  gates)
- **Recommendation**: Optional: Extract accessibility (FR-007) and performance goals into explicit NFR section for
  clarity in future features
- **Severity**: LOW (stylistic preference, not required by template)

**L-2: Template Placement Documentation**

- **Location**: tasks.md T030 marks template placement as "optional demonstration, not functional requirement"
- **Description**: Constitution's "Import Discipline" principle states templates MUST be placed after `</body>`. Task
  T030 treats this as optional.
- **Impact**: Minimal (T030 is demonstration-only; actual requirement is in FR-005 comments and constitution)
- **Recommendation**: Consider rephrasing T030 to clarify that _demonstrating_ template placement is optional, but
  _following_ the placement rule is mandatory when templates are used
- **Severity**: LOW (already compliant via constitution; wording could be clearer)

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Duplication Detection

**Result**: ✅ NO DUPLICATIONS

- **FR-001/FR-002/FR-003**: Each requirement addresses a distinct page (Page A, B, C) with unique layouts
- **FR-004/FR-005/FR-006/FR-007**: Cross-cutting concerns (grid, imports, images, accessibility) with no overlap
- **Tasks**: Appropriately organized by phase and user story; parallelizable tasks marked with [P]
- **Linting tasks**: T014, T024, T034, T043 repeat the same lint commands but target different phases (US1, US2, US3,
  final) — this is intentional phase gating, not duplication

**Validation**: No near-duplicate requirements or redundant task definitions detected.

---

### 2. Ambiguity Detection

**Result**: ✅ NO AMBIGUITIES

All potential ambiguities were resolved in the clarification session (2025-10-29):

- ✅ "Ideal column span ratio" → Clarified to 4+12 columns (FR-001)
- ✅ "How many columns for side nav?" → Clarified to 3 columns (FR-002)
- ✅ "How many sample items?" → Clarified to 5 controls, 10 rows, 4 sections (FR-008)

**Validation**: No vague adjectives (e.g., "several", "many") or unresolved placeholders remain. All quantities and
column spans are explicitly defined.

---

### 3. Underspecification Detection

**Result**: ✅ NO UNDERSPECIFICATION

All requirements include measurable acceptance criteria:

- **FR-001**: Column spans defined (4+12), DOM inspection criteria provided
- **FR-002**: Column spans defined (3+13), UI Shell import pattern specified
- **FR-003**: Single-column flow with subgrid and template placement documented
- **FR-004**: Grid class placement rule (no extra wrappers)
- **FR-005**: Import order rule (styles first, then components)
- **FR-006**: Image dimensions rule (width/height attributes)
- **FR-007**: Accessibility landmarks (main, skip-to-content)
- **FR-008**: Content quantities (5 controls, 10 rows, 4 sections)

**User Stories**: Each includes independent test criteria and 2-3 measurable acceptance scenarios.

**Validation**: All requirements are testable via DOM inspection or visual validation.

| **Theme & Token Fidelity**                 | ✅       | T004 imports Carbon tokens; T013 uses `$layer-01`, `type-style()`; no hard-coded values in plan                                                                              |
| **Grid Integrity & BEM Alignment**         | ✅       | FR-004 enforces grid classes on content containers; T009/T011/T018/T020/T028 specify exact grid classes; T005 defines BEM structures; FR-006 mandates image dimensions       |
| **Import Discipline & Code-Splitting**     | ✅       | FR-005 mandates styles-first import; T008/T017/T027 create page-specific JS modules; T030 demonstrates template placement                                                    |
| **Accessibility, Linting & Quality Gates** | ✅       | FR-007 requires skip-to-content and main landmarks; T014/T024/T034/T043 run all linters; T036 validates accessibility; T040/T041 enforce cross-browser and performance gates |

**Constitution Check in plan.md**: All 5 gates marked ✅ PASS.

**Validation**: No violations of constitution principles detected in requirements or tasks.

### 6. Inconsistency Detection

**Result**: ⚠️ 2 MEDIUM INCONSISTENCIES (already flagged as M-1, M-2)

#### Terminology Consistency

| Term           | spec.md                                                               | plan.md                                | tasks.md                               | Status                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branch name    | `1-grid-layout-showcase`                                              | `001-grid-layout-showcase`             | (not mentioned)                        | ⚠️ Inconsistent                                                |
| Directory path | `specs/1-grid-layout-showcase/demo/`                                  | `specs/001-grid-layout-showcase/demo/` | `specs/001-grid-layout-showcase/demo/` | ⚠️ spec.md differs                                             |
| File naming    | `demo-style.scss` (in tasks), `style.scss` (in spec delivery section) | `demo-style.scss`                      | `demo-style.scss`                      | ✅ tasks/plan aligned; spec delivery section uses generic name |
| Grid classes   | `cds--css-grid-column`, `cds--lg:col-span-N`                          | Same                                   | Same                                   | ✅ Consistent                                                  |
| BEM classes    | `.filter-panel`, `.content-section`, `.content-area`                  | Same                                   | Same                                   | ✅ Consistent                                                  |

**Recommendation**: Update spec.md to use `001-grid-layout-showcase` throughout (branch name, file paths). Optionally
clarify that `style.scss` in spec delivery section refers to `demo-style.scss`.

#### Data Entity Consistency

Per data-model.md (not shown here but referenced in plan):

- **Page A**: FilterPanel (5 controls), DataTable (10 rows) → ✅ Matches FR-008 and T010/T012
- **Page B**: SideNavigation (3 cols), ContentSection (4 sections) → ✅ Matches FR-002 and T021
- **Page C**: ContentSection (4 sections) → ✅ Matches FR-008 and T028

**Validation**: Data model entities consistent with requirements and tasks.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Naming Inconsistencies (Optional, MEDIUM)

1. Update spec.md line 4: `1-grid-layout-showcase` → `001-grid-layout-showcase`
2. Update spec.md SC-001, SC-005, Delivery section: `specs/1-grid-layout-showcase/` → `specs/001-grid-layout-showcase/`
3. Update spec.md Delivery section: Clarify `style.scss` → `demo-style.scss`

**Effort**: 5 minutes | **Impact**: Eliminates developer confusion

### Priority 2: Optional NFR Section (Low)

Extract performance (<500ms) and accessibility gates into explicit NFR section in spec.md for pattern consistency with
future features.

**Effort**: 10 minutes | **Impact**: Improves spec template consistency

### Priority 3: Clarify T030 Wording (Low)

Rephrase T030 to distinguish between "mandatory placement rule when templates exist" vs "optional demonstration of
template usage in this feature."

**Effort**: 2 minutes | **Impact**: Reduces ambiguity in task wording

---

## Conclusion

**VERDICT**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

The feature specification, plan, and task breakdown are consistent, complete, and fully aligned with the Carbon Web
Components Implementation Constitution. The 2 MEDIUM issues are naming inconsistencies that do not block implementation
and can be fixed in ~5 minutes if desired. The 2 LOW issues are optional enhancements for future pattern consistency.

**Next Step**: Proceed to implementation phase (`/speckit.implement` workflow or manual task execution starting with
T001).
