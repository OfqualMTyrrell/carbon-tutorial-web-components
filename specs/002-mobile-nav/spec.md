# Feature Specification: Mobile Navigation Menu Button

**Feature Branch**: `002-mobile-nav`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "At smaller breakpoints the left hand navigation is not available. It should be available
through a menu button, but not in the ui shell header. Work on a feature so users can use the navigation on smaller
breakpoints."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-29

- Q: When the mobile navigation menu is open, should the page content behind it be scrollable or locked? → A: Lock body
  scroll - Page content scroll is disabled when navigation is open, forcing users to close menu before scrolling
  (standard pattern)
- Q: Where exactly should the menu button be positioned within the content area? → A: Top-left corner with standard
  spacing
- Q: Should clicking on the backdrop/overlay area outside the navigation close the menu? → A: Yes, close on backdrop
  click - Clicking anywhere outside the navigation panel closes the menu (standard UX)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Access Navigation on Mobile Devices (Priority: P1)

On small screens (mobile phones, small tablets), users need to access the side navigation menu that is hidden by
default. They accomplish this by clicking a menu button that toggles the navigation panel visibility.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without it, mobile users cannot navigate the application at all.
This is a critical accessibility and usability requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the demo page on a mobile viewport (e.g., 375px width), clicking
the menu button, and verifying the navigation appears and allows interaction. Delivers immediate value by restoring
navigation functionality on mobile devices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is viewing the page on a small viewport (width < 672px), **When** user loads the page, **Then** the
   side navigation is hidden and a menu button is visible in the top-left corner of the content area
2. **Given** the menu button is visible, **When** user clicks the menu button, **Then** the side navigation slides into
   view and becomes accessible
3. **Given** the side navigation is open on mobile, **When** user clicks a navigation link, **Then** the navigation
   closes and the user navigates to the selected section
4. **Given** the side navigation is open on mobile, **When** user clicks the menu button again (or clicks outside the
   navigation on the backdrop), **Then** the navigation slides closed

### User Story 2 - Seamless Responsive Behavior (Priority: P2)

Users resizing their browser window or rotating their device between portrait and landscape should experience smooth
transitions between mobile (menu button) and desktop (always-visible) navigation modes.

**Why this priority**: Ensures consistent experience across device orientations and window sizes. Important for
usability but less critical than basic mobile navigation access.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading the page at desktop width, resizing to mobile width, and verifying the
navigation behavior changes appropriately. Delivers value by maintaining usability during viewport changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is viewing the page at desktop width (≥1056px), **When** user resizes to mobile width (<1056px),
   **Then** the side navigation hides and the menu button appears
2. **Given** user is viewing the page at mobile width with navigation open, **When** user resizes to desktop width
   (≥1056px), **Then** the navigation remains visible and the menu button is hidden
3. **Given** user is on a tablet in portrait mode (medium breakpoint), **When** user rotates to landscape, **Then** the
   navigation adapts to the appropriate layout for the new viewport

### User Story 3 - Accessible Navigation Control (Priority: P2)

Users navigating with keyboard or screen readers need to access the mobile navigation menu through accessible controls
that meet WCAG standards.

**Why this priority**: Required for accessibility compliance and inclusive design. Critical for some users but doesn't
block basic mobile functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating the mobile view using only keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape keys) and
screen reader, verifying all navigation functions are accessible. Delivers value by ensuring the feature is usable by
all users regardless of ability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is navigating with keyboard on mobile viewport, **When** user presses Tab key, **Then** the menu
   button receives focus with visible focus indicator
2. **Given** the menu button has focus, **When** user presses Enter or Space key, **Then** the navigation opens and
   focus moves to the first navigation item
3. **Given** the navigation is open, **When** user presses Escape key, **Then** the navigation closes and focus returns
   to the menu button
4. **Given** user is using a screen reader, **When** user encounters the menu button, **Then** screen reader announces
   the button purpose and current state (expanded/collapsed)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when navigation is open on mobile and a navigation link is clicked? (Should close the menu after
  navigation)
- How does the system handle rapid toggling of the menu button? (Should complete animations smoothly without breaking)
- What happens when user scrolls page content while navigation is open on mobile? (Page body scroll is locked - users
  cannot scroll page content until navigation is closed)
- How does navigation behave when viewport size changes while menu is open? (Should maintain appropriate state for new
  viewport)
- What happens if user has CSS animations disabled or is on a low-performance device? (Should still function with
  instant show/hide)
- What happens if navigation content exceeds viewport height? (Navigation panel itself should scroll independently while
  body remains locked)

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a menu button that is visible only at small and medium breakpoints (viewport width
  <1056px)
- **FR-002**: Menu button MUST be positioned in the top-left corner of the content area using Carbon spacing tokens
  ($spacing-05 or $spacing-06), NOT in the Carbon UI Shell header
- **FR-003**: Menu button MUST follow Carbon Design System button styling and use appropriate Carbon components
- **FR-004**: System MUST toggle side navigation visibility when menu button is clicked
- **FR-005**: Side navigation MUST slide in from the left when opened on mobile viewports
- **FR-006**: Side navigation MUST overlay page content when opened on mobile (using appropriate z-index)
- **FR-007**: System MUST close navigation when user clicks on a navigation link on mobile viewports
- **FR-008**: System MUST close navigation when user clicks on the backdrop area outside the navigation panel on mobile
  viewports
- **FR-009**: Menu button MUST display appropriate icon indicating current state (hamburger menu when closed, close/X
  when open)
- **FR-010**: Menu button MUST include proper ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-controls)
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain focus management - focus should move to navigation when opened and return to button
  when closed
- **FR-012**: Navigation MUST support keyboard navigation (Enter/Space to toggle, Escape to close, Tab to navigate
  items)
- **FR-013**: System MUST automatically hide menu button at large breakpoint (≥1056px) when navigation is always visible
- **FR-014**: System MUST use Carbon spacing tokens for button positioning and navigation spacing
- **FR-015**: System MUST use Carbon motion tokens for open/close animations
- **FR-016**: Navigation panel MUST respect user's prefers-reduced-motion settings
- **FR-017**: System MUST lock body scroll when navigation is open on mobile viewports (prevent page scrolling while
  menu is active)
- **FR-018**: Navigation panel MUST support independent scrolling if navigation content exceeds viewport height
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide a backdrop/overlay behind navigation that users can click to close the menu

### Key Entities

- **Menu Button**: Toggle control positioned in top-left corner of content area with Carbon spacing, visible only at
  sm/md breakpoints, manages navigation visibility state
- **Side Navigation Panel**: Carbon cds-side-nav component that changes from static (desktop) to overlay (mobile)
  behavior based on viewport
- **Navigation State**: Boolean state tracking whether navigation is open/closed on mobile viewports

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users on mobile devices (viewport width <672px) can access all navigation items within 2 clicks (1 click
  to open menu, 1 click to select item)
- **SC-002**: Menu button appears and functions correctly on 100% of viewports below 1056px width
- **SC-003**: Navigation opens and closes smoothly with animation duration of 240ms (Carbon $duration-moderate-02 motion
  token)
- **SC-004**: Menu button and navigation controls are fully keyboard accessible - all actions can be completed using
  only keyboard
- **SC-005**: Screen reader users can successfully open navigation, navigate items, and close navigation using only
  screen reader commands
- **SC-006**: Navigation state changes (open/close) complete without visual glitches or layout shifts
- **SC-007**: Users can complete navigation selection task on mobile in under 5 seconds from page load
- **SC-008**: Zero navigation functionality lost when transitioning between mobile and desktop viewports
